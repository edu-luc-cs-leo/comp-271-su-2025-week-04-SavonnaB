*/ Week 03 reflection
For week 3 I will admit that I did start as Wednesdays are my only desginated free time to do my class assignments most of the time. 
Looking at the original assingment I noted that I wasn't 100% sure that my code would operate properly because I sometimes have issues with logic/syntax.
I just looked at previous examples from class and took the code bit by bit until things made sense from the method standpoint.
I was thoroughly excited when I ran all test and they came back with the "passed" status.
In week 02 I was having issues with getting the tests to run so I felt a bit of satisfaction that it wasn't the case last week.
